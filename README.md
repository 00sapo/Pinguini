# Camilla in the mirror

Camilla in the mirror is a game prototype made in 48 hours for the Global Game Jam 2022. 

You can try the game at [this page](https://antonio-turco.itch.io/global-game-jam-2022)

It’s a game about self-isolation and getting lost in the meanders of our own mind.  The more we focus on self-reflection, the more our points of reference elude us. Sometimes it’s better to lean on our trusted friends.

Will you be able to save Camilla from the maze of her own mind? Or will she be forever stuck in the mirror?

## Instructions

* This is a single-player game. 
* Guide Camilla through the maze and out of the last mirror (which may or may not be represented by a purple placeholder)
* Use the map to check Camilla’s position
* Take her out of the bounds of the maze, and Camilla will lose herself
* Mirrors in the maze invert the game controls, so stay present!

## Controls

* Give directions to Camilla by typing “up”, “down”, “left” or “right” followed by Enter
* Press Enter to progress with dialogue
* Use up and down arrows to scroll the dialogue box
