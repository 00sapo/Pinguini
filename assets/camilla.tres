It glows faintly in the dark.   Beyond my reflection on its surface, there is darkness, with a light at the end. The mirror is not glowing – it's Camilla. She's inside the mirror. Her light refracts through a myriad of glass walls. Or are they mirrors? What kind of mirror is this? I knock on it, but I'm afraid it'll break. The glow flickers in the dark. Camilla raises her head.",
